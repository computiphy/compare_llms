Transformer Parameters Documentation
====================================

This document provides concise explanations of key parameters and metrics used when configuring and evaluating transformer-based language models. It is intended to guide users in understanding and tuning model behavior effectively.

Transformer Parameters
======================

**Stream Chat Response**
Enables incremental output generation, streaming tokens as they are produced.

**Seed**
Controls randomness by setting a deterministic seed for reproducibility.

**Stop Sequence**
A string or list of strings. Generation halts if any are encountered in output.

**Temperature**
Controls randomness in generation. Lower values make output more deterministic.

**Mirostat**
Enables Mirostat sampling, an adaptive algorithm for maintaining target perplexity.

**Mirostat Eta**
Learning rate used in the Mirostat sampling algorithm to adjust output entropy.

**Mirostat Tau**
Target entropy (surprise) level for Mirostat sampling to maintain controlled creativity.

**Top K**
Limits sampling to the top K most probable tokens. Lower K reduces diversity.

**Top P**
Enables nucleus sampling. Chooses from smallest token set with cumulative probability >= P.

**Min P**
Minimum cumulative probability threshold for candidate token selection.

**Frequency Penalty**
Penalizes repeated tokens based on frequency in generated output.

**Repeat Last N**
Limits consideration of last N tokens to discourage repetition.

**Tfs Z**
Tail-Free Sampling parameter that adjusts sampling by removing unlikely tokens.

**Context Length**
Maximum number of tokens the model considers in its attention window.

**Batch Size (num\_batch)**
Number of prompts processed simultaneously. Impacts throughput.

**Tokens To Keep On Context Refresh (num\_keep)**
Number of initial tokens retained during context refresh to maintain coherence.

**Max Tokens (num\_predict)**
Upper limit on the number of tokens the model will generate in a response.

**use\_mmap (Ollama)**
Enables memory mapping of model weights to reduce memory load.

**use\_mlock (Ollama)**
Locks model in RAM to prevent swapping, improving latency stability.

**num\_thread (Ollama)**
Number of CPU threads used during inference.

**num\_gpu (Ollama)**
Number of GPUs allocated for model execution.
